## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I realised that the solutions to some problems are not far fetched, and sometimes you just need  to take a break.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Mr Coder(YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBYPntB-GY) - This helped me figure out exactly the CSS properties needed . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
